              <h2>Basic Animation</h2>
              <p>During this theme we were introduced to concepts of basic animation, classic storytelling and character design as well as work with CSS animations and enhanced interactivity through Javascript.</p>

                <h2>Interactive website</h2>
              </a>
              <p>At the beginning of group work we were introduced to SCRUM which is an iterative and agile development method. I think it will be really useful during my future projects.We’ve learned about the 12 animation principles from Disney, CSS animations and JavaScript to mainly tricker the CSS animations. We were introduced how to make a sprite sheet in Illustrator for a sprite animation in CSS. The aim of the group project was the create an interactive website for a classic movie. Our choice was “The Shining” the iconic thriller. So we had to create our own characters and backgrounds for the site, code the HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After that test the production and related decisions.<br>My focus was to create the mood board and basically I was responsible for the whole coding part. What I’ve learned from that: it can be quite challenging to code everything the way as we imagined from beginner level but it’s okay to realize that.</p>
