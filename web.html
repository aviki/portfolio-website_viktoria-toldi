              <h2>Basic Web</h2>
              <p>In this theme, we got a basic but intensive introduction to HTML and CSS. We were introduced to the basic terminology within user interface design, digital communication, user testing, and responsive web design. Beside coding we also had to learn basic image processing in Photoshop and vector drawing in Illustrator.</p>
              <a href="https://vikidesign.eu/responsive"><h2>Responsive website</h2></a>
              <p>In this task we were introduced to tools which helped us to make our mobile website responsive. So we’ve learned how to use media queries in CSS. We were also introduced to usability testing and user-centered design including test methods like 5 second test and the trunk test. I’ve learned that the design process has really important steps that you better not to skip like sketching, making colour schemes, wireframing and prototyping. If you made this things it will be a lot easier to code the website. During this task we had to also consider the content creation what is relevant for the user and what is not.</p>
