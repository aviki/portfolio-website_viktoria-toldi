              <h2>Basic UX</h2>
              <p>This fourth theme was really comprehensive because we had to use all the tools and skills we gained during the first semester. Our task was to create a product (prototype + website) for a client, based on a client-interview. It gave us a basic understanding of and experience with how interaction between users and user interfaces works, as well as which theories, tools and methods we could use for research, design, testing and production of digital solutions for smartphones.</p>
              <a href="https://vikidesign.eu/fronter"><h2>Fronter prototype</h2></a>
              <p>Based on our previous personality tests I was the implementer in our group but of course I also participated in the part of generating ideas. In the XD prototype my focus was to create the icons in Illustrator. This was one of my personal goal from our Team Canvas that I would like to improve my graphic design skills because in the previous projects I was mostly doing the coding part.</p>
              <p>During this theme I’ve learned that is really important to find the balance between the desire of clients and target group. And last but not least as a future multimedia designer you may use your style as well. Sometimes during the Design Sprint (used Google Sprint Method) group project it was hard to compromise but I think at the and of the week we got better in it.</p>
