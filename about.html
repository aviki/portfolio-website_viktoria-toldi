              <h2>About me</h2>
              <p>My name is Viktoria Toldi, a 22 years old Hungarian student in Multimedia Design. I'm an ex "sociologist" who wants to experience a whole new field. Tired of imagine huge changes I cannot implement so I decided to learn the way of creating small things which may set up movements. In the future I would like to work as a frontend developer. It will be a long journey but I am really excited about it.</p>
              <p>What am I most proud of in my journey? In May 2018 I attended my first 24-hours hackathon organized by E.ON Hungary. Worked on the idea of an application that gives advice how to reduce the energy usage in our homes. At the end of each month it shows our saving. The users can offer their savings for needy families or NGO-s, through their electricity supplier. We achieved 1st place with my partner. I am planning to participate on other future hackathons because I like the way of implementing ideas in a short period of time and competing with international teams.</p>
